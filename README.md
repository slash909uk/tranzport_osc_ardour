# tranzport_osc_ardour
Frontier Tranzport to Ardour interface using OSC (Open Sound Control) and libusb on Linux
Cmd syntax to match Ardour 6 release
inspired by the work of the Ardour team regarding the mapping and display
used in the native integration (which seems no longer available in Ubuntu?)

One might consider externalising the OSC cmd syntax to fit with other DAWs?

Based on an earlier work:
